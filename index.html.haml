  Togglz

%h2
  What is it about?

%p
  Togglz is an implementation of the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html">Feature Toggles</a> pattern for Java.
  Feature Toggles are a very common agile development practices in the context of continuous deployment and delivery.
  The basic idea is to associate a toggle with each new feature you are working on. This allows you to enable or disable these
  features at application runtime, even for individual users.
  Togglz is free and open source, licensed under the <a href="https://github.com/togglz/togglz/blob/master/LICENSE.txt"> Apache License</a>!

  Example

%p
  Features are declared using a regular Java enum type:

%pre(class="prettyprint lang-java")
  :escaped
    public enum MyFeatures implements Feature {

        @Label("First Feature")
        FEATURE_ONE,

        @Label("Second Feature")
        FEATURE_TWO;

        public boolean isActive() {
            return FeatureContext.getFeatureManager().isActive(this);
        }

    }

%p
  Checking whether a specific feature is enabled for the current user is very simple. Just call the <code>isActive()</code>
  method on the feature.

%pre(class="prettyprint lang-java")
  :escaped
    public void someBusinessMethod() {

      if( MyFeatures.FEATURE_ONE.isActive() ) {
        // do new exciting stuff here
      }

      [...]

    }
